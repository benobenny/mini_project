            <h3>Geographical Significance</h3>
            <div class="info-section">
                London, the capital of the United Kingdom, is located in the southeastern part of England, along the banks of the River Thames. The city spans both sides of the river, which has shaped its history and development for over two millennia.<br><br>

                Positioned approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) inland from the North Sea, London benefits from its strategic location, connecting it to both domestic and international trade routes. The city is surrounded by the lush countryside of the Home Counties—including Surrey, Kent, and Essex—and enjoys proximity to important natural and urban landmarks.<br><br>

                London's geography is defined by its mix of historic boroughs and modern metropolitan areas, with notable green spaces like Hyde Park, Richmond Park, and the vast network of canals in East London. Its central location in the UK makes it a hub for transportation, culture, and commerce, cementing its role as one of the world's most influential cities.<br>

            <h3>London City vs. Greater London</h3>
            <div class="info-section">
                London is a city of contrasts, with distinct differences between its historic core, the City of London, and the broader Greater London.<br><br>
                <strong>City of London:</strong> Known as the "Square Mile," this is the ancient heart of London, dating back to Roman times. It is the financial district and the oldest part of the city, home to iconic landmarks like St. Paul's Cathedral, Bank of England, and London Bridge. Despite its small geographical size, it holds immense influence over global finance and commerce.<br><br>
                <strong>Greater London:</strong> This encompasses a much larger area, made up of 32 boroughs and the City of London. It includes everything from the historic sites and cultural institutions in central London to vibrant residential areas and parks like Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Greater London is a modern, sprawling metropolis, offering a blend of history, culture, and modern urban living.<br>
